# Post RIPS

## What can I do after RIPS?
- Publish your work (Tip: If you feel like your paper is not ready, submit your paper anyway. Apply to different journals/conferences, get feedback, edit, and repeat until you get accepted).
- Apply to more research opportunities. Here are some undergraduate research programs:
  - [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme(URO)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/)
  - [UST Research Internship](https://www.ip-korea.org/impact/cultivating.php)
  - [Undergraduate Student Research Awards(USRA)](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp)
  - [Summer Undergraduate Research Program(SUGRP)](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/article/853)
  - [Research Internships in Science and Engineering(RISE)](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/)
  - [Summer Undergraduate Research Exposure(SURE)](https://www.iith.ac.in/news/2024/02/15/Summer-Undergraduate-Research-Exposure/)
  - [NSF ETAP](https://etap.nsf.gov/programs)
  - [NSF funded REUs](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/)
  - [Math REU programs](https://sites.google.com/view/mathreu)
  - [Erasmus Mundus](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters)
- Present at conferences (see below for some suggestions).

## Which conferences do you recommend that I go to?
Here are ones that some of us attended:
- [Joint Mathematics Meetings](https://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm)
- [Nebraska Conference For Undergraduate Women in Mathamatics](https://math.unl.edu/ncuwm)
- [Symposium on Applied Computing](https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2025/)
- [Regional Mathematics and Statistics Conference](https://mathstats.uncg.edu/rmsc/)
- [The Mathematics of Various Entertaining Subjects Conference](https://momath.org/moves-conference/)
- [Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://gcurs.rice.edu/)
  
Here are ones that we have heard of:
- [Association of Computing and Machinery Conferences](https://dl.acm.org/conferences/upcoming?startPage=3&pageSize=10)
- [National Conference on Undergraduate Research(NCUR)](https://ncur.secure-platform.com/2024)
- [Mid-Atlantic Research Exchange(MATRX)](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/event/mid-atlantic-research-exchange-matrx/)

## Where can I print my poster?
- Your home institution.
- [PosterNerd](https://www.posternerd.com/). (Tip: Ask the customer representative for discounts, because sometimes they have deals with conferences.)
- [PosterSmith](https://postersmith.com/). They have high quality cloth posters that are very convenient for travel.

## How do I get funding for travel to present my work?
Ask IPAM and your home institution department first. Some conferences also provide funding, but usually it is not enough. Here are some other ways that can help with travel funds:
- [Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/conference-support/travel-and-registration-support/)
- [European Mathematical Society](https://euromathsoc.org/submit/travel-grant)
- [Assocation for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/awards/awm-grants/travel-grants/#:~:text=Applicants%20must%20be%20women%20holding,past%20two%20years%20is%20ineligible)
- [Association for Computing Machinery's Women in Computing](https://women.acm.org/scholarships/)
- [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/)
